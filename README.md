Analysis of Models for Crypto Price Forecasting.

Preliminary scope of work:

Research question and motivation
In the dynamic realm of virtual currencies, accurately forecasting price has become increasingly crucial. The unprecedented growth and volatility of crypto assets necessitate the evolution and evaluation of robust forecasting models (Chu et al.  2019). While existing literature has extensively explored various forecasting techniques, a clear understanding of the most effective approach remains elusive. This research seeks to address this gap by focusing on the comparison of two prominent models – Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Exponential Smoothing Model with Artificial Neural Networks (ETS-ANN) hybrid (Nasirtafreshi 2022 & Seabe, Lloyd, Moutsinga, and Pindza 2023; Panigrahi, Behera 2017 & Ampountolas, Apostolos 2023). By analyzing the performance of these models against historical cryptocurrency price data, this study aims to provide a nuanced perspective on the accuracy and reliability of deep learning and hybrid method, thereby contributing to the advancement of cryptocurrency forecasting methodologies.

Contribution
This research aims to provide a distinctive contribution within the extensive realm of cryptocurrency forecasting by conducting a thorough comparative analysis of two influential predictive models: the RNN Long Short-Term Memory and the hybrid Exponential Smoothing Model with ANN. By assessing the accuracy of these models in predicting cryptocurrency prices, particularly Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, XRP, and Litecoin, this research seeks to offer a comprehensive understanding of their respective strengths and limitations. Through this analysis, the study aspires to provide valuable insights into the practical applicability of these models in the dynamic and evolving landscape of cryptocurrency markets, thereby enriching the ongoing discourse on optimal forecasting strategies.
Hypothesis:
1.	Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model will outperform.
2.	The performance of forecasting models will vary across different cryptocurrencies, with some cryptocurrencies exhibiting higher predictability and others being more challenging to forecast accurately.


Methodology
To ensure a robust evaluation, the RNN LSTM and ETS-ANN models are implemented using Python, leveraging appropriate libraries such as TensorFlow for deep learning components and Statsmodels for time series analysis. The models undergo a training process, and to adapt to evolving market conditions, rolling windows are employed, allowing the models to capture changing patterns effectively.
The performance of each model is then assessed through established forecasting metrics, including the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), mean absolute error (MAE), and root mean square error (RMSE). These metrics provide a comprehensive view of each model's predictive capabilities and accuracy, facilitating a comparative analysis between the RNN LSTM and ETS-ANN models.
This structured methodology ensures a comprehensive evaluation of the chosen forecasting models, shedding light on their respective strengths and limitations in capturing the intricate dynamics of cryptocurrency price movements. Through this approach, the study aims to contribute valuable insights to the field of cryptocurrency forecasting and enhance our understanding of the applicability of advanced hybrid and deep learning models.
